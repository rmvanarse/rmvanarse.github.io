## Courses Designed:

1. [**Software for Robotics**]() _(Conducted by BITS Goa & BITS Hyd as **Software for Embedded Systems**)_ <br>
  * Designed the course structure, content (theory), labs and projects for CS F424/ CS G523, a course for Masters in Computer Science in BITS Goa
  * The course was designed in Fall 2019 and conducted officially for BITS Goa & BITS Hyderabad CS Masters programme in the Spring 2020 semester.
  * Contents of the course included introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS), development boards (RasPi, Arduino, ESP), sensor interfacing, basic control theory, motion planning & simulations. 
<br><br>

2. [**Intermediate Robotics**](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/cte-archive/tree/master/Sem2_19-20) _(Conducted by [Centre for Tehnical Education, BITS Goa](https://bpgc-cte.org/) )_ <br>
  * Designed the contents of the course
  * Contents included ROS, Gazebo, RViz, Motion Planning, Forward/Inverse kinematics and Computer Vision.
  * This course was conducted in Spring 2020 by [ERC](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/) BITS Goa.
