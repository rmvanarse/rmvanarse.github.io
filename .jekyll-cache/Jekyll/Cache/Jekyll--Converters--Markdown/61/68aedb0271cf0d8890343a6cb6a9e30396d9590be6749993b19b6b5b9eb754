I"¹<p>This project involved automation of multiple processes in a recycling facility using computer vision and robotics. In the first phase, a vision based system was designed and deployed on forklifts to intelligently classify different classes of paper that look very similar to each other, but require very different processes for recycling.</p>

<p>The main challenges in this task were a large number of classes (80+) that visually look very similar and skewed distributions (70%+ crates were a single type of paper, while many classes contributed to less than 0.1% of the crates). Another challenge was unavailability of data from the recycling facility, and therefore, having to rely on datasets from a different distribution. These challenges were addressed using methods such as domain adaptation, contrastive learning, and hierarchical classification.</p>
