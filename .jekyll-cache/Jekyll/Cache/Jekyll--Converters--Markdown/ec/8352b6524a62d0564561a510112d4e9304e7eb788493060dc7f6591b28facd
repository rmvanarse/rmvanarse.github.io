I"á<p><strong>Swarmbots</strong> is a project on development of algorithms for automation of a swarm of autonomous mobile robots. The robots perform various tasks through â€˜collective decision makingâ€™.
Multi-robot systems become increasingly complex with an increase in the number of robots. In this project, a swarm of robots is entirely decentralized and each robot knows only the approximate relative position of its neighbours. Furthermore, the bots do not rely on inter-robot communication, localization or memory, and possess only minimal local sensing &amp; processing capabilities. They perform tasks collectively through â€˜swarm intelligenceâ€™ algorithms.</p>

<p>The project attempts to break down complex coordinated tasks into simpler sub-tasks such as <strong>Agregation</strong>, <strong>Line-formation</strong>, <strong>Shape-formation</strong>, <strong>Area-Coverage</strong>, <strong>Flocking</strong>, <strong>Following</strong>, etc. The project was started in 2019 with RasPi-controlled differential drive robots, and was moved to simulations in 2020.</p>

<p>The project implemented the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Area Search:</strong> The robots disperse and collectively explore an area.</li>
  <li><strong>Foraging/ Resource Gathering:</strong> The robots search for &amp; collectively transport resources to a â€˜nestâ€™ at an unknown location.</li>
  <li><strong>Contamination Removal:</strong> The robots create a perimeter around gradually growing contaminations and neutralize them</li>
</ol>

<p>These tasks were implemented weighted combinations of basic swarm-behaviours such as aggregation, dispersion, exploration, line formation, shape formation, surrounding items and consensus.</p>
