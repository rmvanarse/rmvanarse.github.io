<strong>Abstract:</strong> An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that measures the linear acceleration and angular velocity of a robot/vehicle is constrained due to physical limitations such as noise, drifts, misalignments and offsets. In order to minimize the drift in state estimates over time, accurate calibration is required.</p>

<p>The key contribution of this project was the development of a method for continuous real-time calibration and self-correction for an IMU, which quickly adapts to changing parameters. This method was tested with simulated as well as real data. The second contribution of this project was a comparison study of attitude estimation algorithms that fuse data from an accelerometer and magnetometer to estimate a robotâ€™s orientation.</p>
