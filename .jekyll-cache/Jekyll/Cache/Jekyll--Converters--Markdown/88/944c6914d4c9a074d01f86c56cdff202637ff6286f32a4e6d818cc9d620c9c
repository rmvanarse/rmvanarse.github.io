<hr />

<p>I am a roboticist with a passion for autonomous navigation, computer vision and AI. My research interests are centered around <strong>perception and path planning for mobile robots</strong>, specifically in challenging and unstructured environments. This includes topics such as sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), perception-aware planning, and semantic scene understanding. I am constantly seeking to learn more and develop innovative solutions in these areas, with the ultimate goal of applying them to real-world scenarios such as space exploration and search &amp; rescue.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various research projects in this field. I have worked as a Perception Engineer at <strong>IAM Robotics</strong> and as a Research Associate at the <strong>Biorobotics Lab</strong> in the Robotics Institute at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>. I have also gained valuable experience during my internships at <strong>Open Robotics</strong> and the <strong>Autonomous Systems Lab at the UC Santa Cruz</strong>. I did my undergraduate thesis was on Visual-Inertial SLAM for Underwater Robots at the <strong>Autonomous Robots Lab in University of Nevada, Reno</strong>. I also worked on motion planning for indoor robots, robot swarms and modular robots during my undergraduate studies at <strong>BITS Goa (India)</strong>, where I acquired a degree in Computer Science and designed &amp; taught several courses in Robotics.</p>

<p>I am always eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of robotics and looking for new opportunities to contribute to the robotics community.
