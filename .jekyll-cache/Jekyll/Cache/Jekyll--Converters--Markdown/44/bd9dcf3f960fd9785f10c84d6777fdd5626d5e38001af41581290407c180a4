I"E<p><strong>The LED Globe</strong> was a large semicircular arc <em>(1.5m diameter)</em> lined with RGB LEDs. By rotating at a high speed about a vertical axis, it could display images mid-air, like a hologram.</p>

<p>Each image was split into vertical segments, that were sent to the LEDs in a timed manner as the arc rotated. With a sufficient speed of rotation, the whole image appears mid-air, due to persistance of vision.</p>

<p>This project was done as a display project by the <a href="https://erc-bpgc.github.io/projects.html"><strong>Electronics and Robotics Club</strong></a>, for <strong>Quark</strong>, the technical fest of BITS Goa. The project was displayed on Day 3 of Quark 2019 <em>(3rd Feb 2019)</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Role in  Project:</strong> Designed the circuits and their PCBs, planning the overall method</em></p>
