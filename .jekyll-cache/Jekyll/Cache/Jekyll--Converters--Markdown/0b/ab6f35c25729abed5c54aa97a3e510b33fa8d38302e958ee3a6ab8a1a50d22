I"<p><strong>Modular Robots</strong> are a system of individual modules that are capable of physically linking with each other to form structures suited for different purposes. These structures are able to reconfigure themselves into  different configurations, each suited for a different objective. This ability provides versatility to the robots. Whenever the bot comes across a new situation, it can change its configuration to form a ‘new’ bot suited for the task at hand. Thus, a single system can be used for a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>The modbots project  of BITS Goa was started in April 2018 under the <a href="https://erc-bpgc.github.io/"><strong>Electronics &amp; Robotics Club</strong></a>, in the <strong>Sandbox</strong> Laboratory. A double-module with 6 degrees of freedom was designed and manufactured, with the aim of mitigating limitations of existing modbots. The module uses mechanical linkage. A full circuitry with all the required sensors and actuators was developed and incorporated in the module. Basic motion functionalities were developed.</p>

<p>Future stages of the project will include reconfiguration studies and development of specialized modules.</p>
