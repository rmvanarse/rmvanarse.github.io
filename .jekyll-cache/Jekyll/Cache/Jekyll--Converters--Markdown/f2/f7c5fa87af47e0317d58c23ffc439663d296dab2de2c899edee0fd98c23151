I")<p><sub>Underwater visual odometry poses several challenges due to attenuation of light, reflections, suspended particles, poor features, absence of GPS, inability to use LIDARs, etc. A light-transmission based image enhancement pipeline was developed in this project to eleminate degradations in underwater visual data and improve the performance of SLAM &amp; VIO systems with underwater robots.</sub></p>

<p><sub>The method was tested on several open source visual inerial datasets from a vareity of underwater environments, with ORB SLAM3 (and partly with ROVIO and OKVIS).</sub></p>
