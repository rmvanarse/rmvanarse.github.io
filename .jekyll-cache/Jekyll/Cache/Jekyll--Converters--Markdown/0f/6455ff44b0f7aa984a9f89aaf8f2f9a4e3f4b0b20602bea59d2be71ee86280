<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Birds and insects, found in nature, are collectively capable of performing complex tasks despite possessing little intelligence. Swarm Robotics draws inspiration from these behaviours in nature to give a group of ‘unintelligent’ robots the ability to show intelligent behaviours through ‘swarm intelligence’ and ‘collective decision making’ algorithms</p>
