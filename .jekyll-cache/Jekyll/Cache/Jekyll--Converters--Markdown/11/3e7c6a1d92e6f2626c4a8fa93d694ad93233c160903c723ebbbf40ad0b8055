I"A<p><sub>Signature verification involves distinguishing between authentic signatures and forgeries. Inspired from facial recognition networks, a one-shot learning convolutional neural network was designed to detect forgeries of a given signature.</sub></p>

<p><sub>A Siamese architecture was developed using PyTorch and was trained using triplet loss. A dataset containing several authentic signatures &amp; forged signatures of around 2600 people <em>(around 75,000 samples)</em> was used. The final network converts the input signatures to a lower-dimensional embedding vector for comparison. It is able to identify forgeries even with only one or two true signatures for reference.</sub></p>
