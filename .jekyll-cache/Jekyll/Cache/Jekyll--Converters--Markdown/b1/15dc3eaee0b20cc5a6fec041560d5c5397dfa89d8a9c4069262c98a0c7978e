<p><sub>I am a Robotics enthusiast with a Bachelorâ€™s in Engineering (B.E.) in <strong>Computer Science</strong> from <strong>BITS Pilani Goa</strong>.</sub></p>

<p><sub>I find the fields of Autonomous Robotics, Computer Vision and AI fascinating. For the past three years, I have been working in several projects related to <em>Perception in Robots, Simultaneous Localization &amp; Mapping (SLAM), Path Planning, Classical &amp; DL-based computer vision</em> and <em>Multi-robot systems</em>. Furthermore, I am also interested in working in research projects on semantic understanding of environment, Graph Neural Networks, GANs and Perception-aware motion planning in robots, in future.</sub></p>

<p><sub>I am currently working as an Undergraduate Researcher with the <strong>Autonomous Robots Lab, NTNU</strong> under Prof. Kostas Alexis. I was formerly the <strong>Sub-Coordinator</strong> of the <strong>Electronics &amp; Robotics Club</strong> of BITS Goa.</sub></p>
