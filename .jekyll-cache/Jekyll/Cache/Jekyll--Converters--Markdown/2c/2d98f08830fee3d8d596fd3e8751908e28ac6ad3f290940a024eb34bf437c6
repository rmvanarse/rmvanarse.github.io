<hr />

<p>I am a roboticist with a passion for autonomous navigation, computer vision and AI. My research interests are centered around <strong>perception and path planning for mobile robots</strong>, specifically in challenging and unstructured environments. This includes fields like sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), perception-aware planning, and semantic scene understanding. I am constantly seeking to learn more and develop innovative solutions in these areas, with the ultimate goal of applying them to real-world scenarios such as space exploration and search &amp; rescue.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various research &amp; development projects in ground, aerial and underwater robotics. This includes work with different research labs across the world, companies, educational institutes and open source organizations. I also love teaching and have had the opportunity to design and teach several courses in robotics.</p>

<p>I am always eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of robotics and looking for new opportunities to contribute to the robotics community!
