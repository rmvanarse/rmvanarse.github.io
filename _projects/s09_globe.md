**The LED Globe** was a large semicircular arc _(1.5m diameter)_ lined with RGB LEDs. By rotating at a high speed about a vertical axis, it could display images mid-air, like a hologram.

Each image was split into vertical segments, that were sent to the LEDs in a timed manner as the arc rotated. With a sufficient speed of rotation, the whole image appears mid-air, due to persistance of vision.

This project was done as a display project by the [**Electronics and Robotics Club**](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/projects.html), for **Quark**, the technical fest of BITS Goa. The project was displayed on Day 3 of Quark 2019 _(3rd Feb 2019)_.

_**Role in  Project:** Designed the circuits and their PCBs, planning the overall method_
