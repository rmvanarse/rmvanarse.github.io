<sub>**Swarmbots** is a project on development of algorithms for automation of a swarm of autonomous mobile robots. The robots perform various tasks through 'collective decision making'.</sub>

<sub>Multi-robot systems become increasingly complex with increase in the numbre of robots. In this project, the system is entirely decentralized. Each robot knows only its own position and the position of its neighbours. Furthermore, the bots do not communicate with each other and take their own decisions, such that the emergent behaviour of the entire swarm is a useful task</sub>

{% include gallery caption="**Swarmbots:** All tasks are decentralized, i.e. each robot takes its own decisions. The images show the emergent collective behaviours of **Line Formation** _(Left)_, **Cirle Formation** _(Centre)_ and **Area-coverage** _(Right)_"%}
<sub>The project attempts to break down complex coordinated tasks into simpler sub-tasks such as **Agregation**, **Line-formation**, **Shape-formation**, **Area-Coverage**, **Flocking**, **Following**, etc. The project was started in 2019 with RasPi-controlled differential drive robots, and was moved to simulations in 2020.</sub>

<sub>_**Role in  Project:** Project Lead, Algorithms, Simulation_</sub>
