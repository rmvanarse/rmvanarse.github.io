# About Me
---

I am a roboticist with a passion for autonomous navigation, computer vision and AI. My research interests are centered around **perception and path planning for mobile robots**, specifically in challenging and unstructured environments. This includes topics such as sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), perception-aware planning, and semantic scene understanding. I am constantly seeking to learn more and develop innovative solutions in these areas, with the ultimate goal of applying them to real-world scenarios such as space exploration and search & rescue.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various research projects in this field. I have worked as a Perception Engineer at **IAM Robotics** and as a Research Associate at the **Biorobotics Lab** in the Robotics Institute at **Carnegie Mellon University**. I have also gained valuable experience during my internships at **Open Robotics** and the **Autonomous Systems Lab at the UC Santa Cruz**. I did my undergraduate thesis was on Visual-Inertial SLAM for Underwater Robots at the **Autonomous Robots Lab in University of Nevada, Reno**. I also worked on motion planning for indoor robots, robot swarms and modular robots during my undergraduate studies at **BITS Goa (India)**, where I acquired a degree in Computer Science and designed & taught several courses in Robotics. 

I am always eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of robotics and looking for new opportunities to contribute to the robotics community.
